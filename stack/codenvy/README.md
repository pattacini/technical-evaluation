This is the Codenvy description of the Factory used to build the workspace.

### Instructions
1. Create the factory within Codenvy by uploading the configuration file `factory.json`.
1. Make the alias `http://tiny.cc/iit-codenvy-factory` point to the factory URL. The alias is a placeholder of the factory that will stay unchanged and, as such, it can be included anywhere needed.
